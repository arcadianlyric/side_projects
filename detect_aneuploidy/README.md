We perform this test as part of our fertility panel.  We provided data of two batches (batch_1, batch_2) that include a number of samples with this abnormality. The objective of this data challenge is to estimate the number of X and Y chromosomes for each sample.  Each batch includes two files:  Depth:  This file has the average depth of each interval for each sample.  Interval_order:  This file has chromosome, start and end of the intervals in ‘Depth.csv’. The order of the rows in ‘Interval_order.csv’ file is the same as the order of the rows in ‘Depth.csv’ file in a given batch. Note that chromosomes X and Y are indexed as 23 and 24, respectively.  ![img](app_snapshot.png)
